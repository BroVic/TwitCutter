# TwitCutter
... is currently under development.

Please do not attempt to build with *CMake* at this stage. If wont to experiment with this project before release, build it with VC++ (i.e. `cl.exe`) using `Twitcutter.sln` as root.  

Access to Twitter's REST API is accomplished with [BroVic's fork](https://github.com/BroVic/twitcurl) of [swatkat](https://github.com/swatkat)'s C++ library, **twitcurl**.

At the moment there are 3 binaries being outputted by this repository:

* `twitcurl.lib`
* `twitcut.exe`
* `twitcutGui.exe`
